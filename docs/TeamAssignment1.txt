Idea 1: 

An event planner that organizes events over the next week depending on the user's location.
The project will use Facebook login and event data from both Facebook and Eventbrite.
The events will be organized in different categories.

For example, if the user is in Boston, the web app will display events from both Facebook and Eventbrite and organize them.
The events will be linked to a Facebook event page or an Eventbrite page.


Idea 2:

A cheap flight finder that based on your interests and profile information like user location.

The project will use Facebook login and profile information to organize suggested flights using Hitchhiker Flights API. (other APIs used to determine locations to us in Hitchhiker)

For example, it will use key profile information  (likes etc.) against what different destinations have to offer and will provide a personal assortment for upcoming flights at their cheapest times.
